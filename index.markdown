The Retreat of TBD is 3 days and nights of intense connection, play, personal growth ... and/or whatever you want it to be. Offer sessions on whatever you like, and participate in other sessions that interest you.

What sessions will be offered? Depends on who comes. It's probably safe to say they will include things on movement, communication, breaking through barriers, playing, singing, and really anything anyone is passionate enough to bring into the space. They can be a skill share (e.g. Learn to slackline), a discussion (Let's talk about gender in my community), a question (How can I better show up for my partner?), or even a space (Let's sit around the fire and draw). Up to you!

# Our Values

## Agency (Law of Personal Mobility)

Choose your own adventure. We'll use Open Space to schedule sessions, and you get to bring whatever you need/want to the space. In fact, we're co-creating this whole event with you.
 
## Work

This is a place to come and do your work, with support. It'll be fun too! But we want to explicitly focus on moving ourselves forward.
 
## Body, Mind, & Heart

We want to create a space that invites all parts of ourselves to show up. Bring your whole self.
 
## Safer / Stretch Space

We actively encourage people to stretch past comfort to find their work. In this space, we all strive to be welcoming, engaging, and supportive - helping and holding each other should we need it.
